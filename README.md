# BhashaBlend

BhashaBlend is a user-friendly software designed for multilingual dubbing of videos from any language to various other languages using advanced speech recognition and natural language processing (NLP) technologies. This project aims to enhance language accessibility and promote cultural inclusivity by enabling seamless audio-video synchronization and accurate translations.

## Features

- **Audio Extraction**: Extracts audio content from video files with high fidelity.
- **Speech-to-Text Conversion**: Transcribes audio content into text format with high accuracy and precision.
- **Text Translation**: Utilizes the Google Cloud Translation API for accurate text translation between languages.
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**: Generates natural-sounding speech from translated text using text-to-speech (TTS) technology.
- **Audio Processing and Synchronization**: Ensures efficient audio processing and precise synchronization with video frames using the Moviepy and pydub libraries.

## Algorithm Used

1. **Speech Recognition (Whisper ASR)**: Employs advanced algorithms for accurate transcription of spoken dialogue.
2. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Analyzes linguistic features to ensure accurate translations and natural-sounding dialogue adaptation.
3. **Machine Translation**: Utilizes neural machine translation (NMT) for precise text translation between languages.
4. **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Synthesizes natural-sounding speech from translated text.
5. **Audio Processing and Synchronization**: Implements algorithms for efficient audio processing and synchronization with video frames.

## Result

The BhashaBlend software empowers content creators and media professionals to dub English videos into multiple languages effortlessly. By leveraging cutting-edge technologies, it enhances the viewing experience for diverse global audiences, driving greater engagement across different language markets.
